> The Free Alpha Vantage API is very limited, with only 25 requests/day. ssstocks on the other hand, requires making 2 calls per company to acquire the required data.

> Because of this, I'm using the demo API, which allows access to only the data for IBM (and is intentionally slower, it seems)

- **`Zustand`** simple state management library for React

- **`Tailwind CSS`** the framework that's one of the better ways to write CSS
